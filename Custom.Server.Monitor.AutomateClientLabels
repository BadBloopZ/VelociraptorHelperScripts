description: |
    This server side event monitoring artifact watches for new client enrollments and automatically labels them according to their domain roles.
    
    * Standalone & Member Workstations will get the label `Workstation` assigned.
    * Standalone & Member Servers will get the label `Server` assigned.
    * Primary & Backup Domain Controller will get the label `DomainController` assigned.
    
    Relabeling of all clients even after they were enrolled can be achieved by starting a hunt for `Generic.Client.Info`. The labels are either Set or Cleared so it is fine to re-apply the label many times. See https://docs.velociraptor.app/knowledge_base/tips/automating_labels/
